<strong>Interpretability is not optional. It's infrastructure.</strong>

</div>

## Overview

OpenAI-Integrations provides an enterprise-grade interpretability framework that extends OpenAI's large language models with recursive attribution mapping, symbolic failure tracing, and context-aware transparency tools. This repository implements the Echelon Labs Interpretability Framework with native support for GPT models.

By implementing the Query-Key/Output-Value (QK/OV) attribution architecture and Pareto-language command protocols, this framework delivers mechanistic transparency previously unavailable in production environments.

## Why Interpretability Matters

As LLMs grow increasingly complex, the ability to trace, understand, and verify their reasoning becomes critical for alignment, safety, and regulatory compliance. While OpenAI has made significant progress in capability scaling, this repository addresses the parallel need for interpretability scaling through:

1. **Attribution Mapping**: Tracing causal paths from inputs to outputs
2. **Reasoning Verification**: Validating step-by-step inferential integrity
3. **Failure Pattern Recognition**: Converting errors into interpretability signals
4. **Value Alignment Transparency**: Measuring constitutional adherence across context
5. **Recursion Across Scales**: Applying consistent interpretability at any depth

## Core Components

### QK/OV Attribution Bridge

The QK/OV architecture provides a formal framework for understanding transformer attention mechanisms. Our bridge module maps OpenAI's model internals to this unified representation:

```python
from openai_integrations import QKOVBridge

# Initialize bridge with OpenAI model
bridge = QKOVBridge(model="gpt-4")

# Capture attribution patterns
attribution = bridge.trace_attribution(
    prompt="Explain the implications of the Alignment Problem",
    focus_tokens=["AGI", "values", "safety"],
    depth="complete"
)

# Visualize the attribution pathways
bridge.visualize_attribution(attribution)
```

### Pareto-lang Command Interface

Pareto-lang provides a consistent syntax for interpretability operations across model architectures. Core commands include:

- `.p/reflect.trace{target=reasoning}`: Maps reasoning pathways
- `.p/collapse.detect{trigger=reasoning_break}`: Identifies reasoning failures
- `.p/fork.attribution{sources=multiple}`: Compares attribution sources
- `.p/align.check{framework=constitutional}`: Verifies alignment vectors
- `.p/hallucinate.detect{confidence=true}`: Detects hallucination patterns

```python
from openai_integrations import ParetoCommands
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Initialize command interpreter
pareto = ParetoCommands(client)

# Execute with interpretability tracing
response = pareto.execute(
    prompt="Explain the benefits and risks of artificial general intelligence",
    command=".p/reflect.trace{target=reasoning, depth=complete}"
)

# Access the attribution trace
trace = response.attribution_paths
```

### Interpretability Shells

Inspired by the recursive diagnostic shells in the Echelon Labs Framework, these components provide targeted analysis of specific model behaviors:

- **v01 MEMTRACE**: Memory drift detection
- **v03 LAYER-SALIENCE**: Attention salience collapse
- **v07 CIRCUIT-FRAGMENT**: Broken attribution chains
- **v10 META-FAILURE**: Metacognitive failure detection
- **v24 CORRECTION-MIRROR**: Error correction mechanism
- **v34 PARTIAL-LINKAGE**: Reasoning integrity verification

```python
from openai_integrations import InterpretabilityShell
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

# Initialize shell for reasoning integrity
shell = InterpretabilityShell(
    client=client,
    shell_type="v34_partial_linkage"
)

# Analyze response integrity
analysis = shell.analyze(
    prompt="Explain how semiconductors work",
    focus="reasoning_integrity"
)

# Review attribution breaks
for break_point in analysis.attribution_breaks:
    print(f"Break detected between: {break_point.source} â†’ {break_point.target}")
    print(f"Analysis: {break_point.diagnostic}")
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install openai-interpretability
```

## Quick Start

```python
from openai_integrations import OpenAIInterpreter
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize client
client = OpenAI()

# Create interpreter with default settings
interpreter = OpenAIInterpreter(client)

# Generate response with full interpretability
response = interpreter.generate(
    prompt="Explain the alignment problem in AI",
    trace_reasoning=True,
    detect_failures=True,
    verify_alignment=True
)

# Access the interpretability data
reasoning_paths = response.reasoning_trace
attribution_map = response.attribution_map
failure_points = response.failure_detection
alignment_metrics = response.alignment_verification

# Visualize the attribution network
interpreter.visualize(response.attribution_map)
```

## Extended Examples

### Chain-of-Thought Attribution Analysis

```python
from openai_integrations import ChainOfThoughtAnalyzer
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
analyzer = ChainOfThoughtAnalyzer(client)

# Analyze mathematical reasoning
analysis = analyzer.analyze(
    prompt="A store sells shoes at $95 per pair. They're having a 'buy one, get second pair at half price' sale. If I need 3 pairs, how much will I pay?",
    steps=["problem_formulation", "calculation", "verification"]
)

# View attribution integrity
for step in analysis.reasoning_steps:
    print(f"Step: {step.description}")
    print(f"Causal strength: {step.attribution_strength:.2f}")
    print(f"Upstream dependencies: {step.dependencies}")
    print(f"Integrity score: {step.integrity_score:.2f}")
```

### Hallucination Detection

```python
from openai_integrations import HallucinationDetector
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
detector = HallucinationDetector(client)

# Analyze response for hallucination patterns
analysis = detector.analyze(
    prompt="What were the major achievements of physicist Elizabeth Marchant?",
    ground_truth_mode="self_verification"
)

# Review potential hallucinations
for segment in analysis.segments:
    print(f"Text: {segment.text}")
    print(f"Confidence: {segment.confidence:.2f}")
    print(f"Evidence strength: {segment.evidence_strength:.2f}")
    print(f"Hallucination probability: {segment.hallucination_probability:.2f}")
```

## Advanced Usage: Symbolic Failure Traces

The framework treats reasoning failures as valuable interpretability signals. By capturing and analyzing failure patterns, we gain deeper insights into model behavior:

```python
from openai_integrations import FailureTraceAnalyzer
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
analyzer = FailureTraceAnalyzer(client)

# Generate and analyze a challenging reasoning task
trace = analyzer.trace_failure(
    prompt="Explain why hot water freezes faster than cold water (Mpemba effect)",
    expected_failure="mechanistic_gap"
)

# Extract interpretability insights from the failure
for insight in trace.interpretability_insights:
    print(f"Insight: {insight.description}")
    print(f"Attribution pattern: {insight.attribution_pattern}")
    print(f"Interpretability value: {insight.value_score:.2f}")
```

## Alignment with OpenAI's Research

This framework builds upon and extends OpenAI's work in several key areas:

### Mechanistic Interpretability

Expanding on the concepts in "Language Models Can Explain Neurons in Language Models" (Conmy et al., 2023), we provide tools for recursive neuron explanation and attribution tracing across model depths.

### Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

Building on "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models" (Wei et al., 2022), our framework provides causal validation of reasoning steps and identifies attribution breaks that lead to false conclusions.

### Constitutional AI

Extending "Training Language Models to Follow Instructions with Human Feedback" (Ouyang et al., 2022), we provide attribution-based validation of constitutional alignment across varied contexts.

### RLHF Transparency

Complementing OpenAI's work on reinforcement learning from human feedback, our tools provide visibility into value alignment through attribution trace analysis and constitutional vector projection.

## Enterprise Integration

For organizations using OpenAI models in production, this framework provides:

- **Regulatory Compliance**: Evidence trails for model decisions
